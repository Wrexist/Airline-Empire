# Airline Empire — Technical Debt Register

Known debt, tracked honestly. Nothing here is "acceptable"; each item carries
a resolution path.

## TD-001 — Agent environment cannot build or test Swift
**Severity:** ~~Critical~~ RESOLVED 2026-08-25 — Swift 6.0.3 installed via GitHub mirror (D-009); `swift test` verified. Residual: iOS app target still needs macOS (B-002, structural).
**Introduced:** Pre-existing environment condition, recorded Phase 0
(2026-08-25).
**Description:** The remote Linux agent environment has no Swift toolchain and
the network policy denies `download.swift.org`, so one cannot be installed
in-session. `xcodebuild` is impossible on Linux regardless.
**Resolution path:** Owner allowlists swift.org and adds a toolchain setup
script, or implementation phases run on macOS. Tracked as task AE-001 and
blocker B-001 in `/docs/PROJECT_AUDIT.md` §4.

## TD-002 — Event-stream subscription task lingers across game restarts
**Severity:** P3 (bounded leak, rare path).
**Introduced:** Phase 14 (GameController.subscribe), recorded during the
AE-023 static integration audit (2026-08-26).
**Description:** Starting a second game within one app run replaces the
`GameSession` but never terminates the previous session's event
`AsyncStream` consumer task; it idles until the old stream terminates.
One idle task per restart, no unbounded growth per session.
**Resolution path:** Hold the subscription `Task` in GameController and
cancel it before creating a new session.
**RESOLVED 2026-08-26:** GameController now stores `eventTask`, cancels
it on re-subscribe, and clears `recentEvents` so a new game never shows
the previous game's feed. Static fix (parse-checked); exercised for real
in the macOS pass like the rest of the app target.

discovered later.)*

## TD-003 — The map's rendering claims are compile-deep only
**Severity:** P1 for confidence, P0 for nothing — the code may be perfect; the
point is that nobody knows.
**Introduced:** map overhaul (MASTER PROMPT 2), 2026-08-29.
**Description:** `AirlineEmpireApp/Sources/Map/` (6 files, ~2,000 lines) is a
`Canvas` renderer, a camera, a hit-tester and a chrome layer. Everything about
it that matters is a runtime property: does the projection look right at each
zoom, do labels actually avoid each other on a 393pt-wide screen, does a
`SimultaneousGesture` of drag and magnify behave, does the 30fps timeline hold
403 flights on real silicon, does `DispatchQueue.main.async` from inside the
draw closure land before the next tap. A green macOS `xcodebuild` job proves
only that it compiles. Measured performance in this repo comes from
`ae-map-bench`, which times the **model**, on Linux, on a server CPU — it says
nothing about drawing.
**Resolution path:** `docs/APPLE_VALIDATION.md` gains a map section: simulator
at each zoom level, Instruments on a large save at 16x, VoiceOver over the
canvas, Reduce Motion, and a pass on the smallest supported screen. Until
then, no claim about how the map *looks* or *performs on device* is supported.

## TD-004 — Hit geometry is written from inside the draw closure
**Severity:** P2 (correct in practice, unusual by construction).
**Introduced:** map overhaul, 2026-08-29.
**Description:** `MapFrame` records the points it drew and `MapScreen` writes
them into `MapHitGeometry` from inside the `Canvas` renderer, so a tap
resolves against the frame the player actually saw rather than against a
recomputed layout. This is a side effect in a draw, which is not how SwiftUI
views usually behave. It is safe for one specific reason: `MapHitGeometry` is
a plain class and deliberately *not* `@Observable`, so writing it cannot
invalidate the view that produced it — observing it would be a redraw loop at
30 frames a second. The first version routed the write through
`DispatchQueue.main.async`. That compiled (CI run 33247689097) but bought
nothing: it cost a frame of staleness and leaned on the hop landing before the
next tap, to protect against a re-entrancy that cannot happen here.
**Resolution path:** if it ever misbehaves, compute the layout once per
snapshot outside the draw and have both the renderer and the hit-tester read
that, at the cost of doing projection work the frame will redo. Not done now
because it trades a real simplification for a hypothetical bug.

## TD-005 — Coastlines are hand-authored, at one level of detail
**Severity:** P3 (aesthetic ceiling, not a defect).
**Introduced:** map overhaul, 2026-08-29.
**Description:** `WorldGeometry.swift` carries 631 coordinate pairs across 24
landmasses, typed by hand. It reads well at world and regional zoom and gets
visibly coarse at local zoom, where a coastline is a few long straight lines.
Adding real Natural Earth data would fix the fidelity and cost a data pipeline,
a licence note, and a dependency the project has so far refused.
**Resolution path:** if local zoom becomes a place players spend time, import
Natural Earth 110m/50m as a generated Swift source at build time (no runtime
dependency, no network), keeping the hand-authored set as the low-detail LOD.
